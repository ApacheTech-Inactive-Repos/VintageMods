# Vintage Mods

A collection of mods, made for the game Vintage Story, written by Apache.

## VintageMods Core

These projects form a framework for rapid mod development.

## Waypont Extensions

Quickly and easily add waypoints to the map at the player's current position.

## Future Mod Ideas: 

#### Night Vision (Coming Soon!)

Adds night vision for Spectator and Creative Mode.

#### World Edit Redux (Coming Soon!)

A complete replacement for the terrible implementation of World Edit in the base game.
Ported from Minecraft, with all the same functionality, including the fabled Wooden Axe.

#### Extra Chisel Modes (Coming Soon!)

Adds new modes for the chisel, including Plane, and Connected Texture.

#### A Mod Called Wanda (Coming Soon!)

 • Wand of Construction: Extend your builds easily with this wand. Has several modes and also features undo for the last two building operations.

 • Wand of Destruction: Quickly destroy connected blocks of the same type within a small area.
 
 • Wand of Feathering: Shift-Left Click to add a block type to the wand. Upto nine different block types can be added. Right Click will choose one of those block types at random, and place it in the world from your inventory. Perfect for creating random feathered textures, and detailing work.

 • Wand of Equal Trade: Select a block and make sure you have enough of that block in your inventory. Then you can replace other blocks with that block. Has a single mode, 3x3 mode, 5x5 mode and a 7x7 mode.

 • Wand of Displacement: Pick up a block (including chests, lanterns, chiselled blocks, etc.) and place it down elsewhere. Configurable to make it more expensive to move some blocks, and it is also possible to blacklist blocks from being moved.

 • Wand of Teleportation: Right click forward to teleport (by default) 30 blocks. If you right click on a block then the player will be teleported on that block if there is room. If not the player will be teleported next to the block. While you are holding the wand, your picking range is increased.

 • Wand of Imprisonment: Capture any living mob (passive, neutral, or hostile) with a left click. Release it again with a right click. Doesn't work on players.

 • Wand of Illumination: Light up dark places easily with this wand. Comes in a range of colours!

 • Wand of Acceleration: Speed up processes such as bloomeries, campfires, etc.

 • Wand of Liquid Displacement: Pick up a source block of liquid (water, or lava), with left click. Place it down somewhere else with right click.
